# PolyJump
A 3D OpenGL Renderer written in Java with Voxel Support.

This was my first coding project out of college. It's writen in Java. The origional plan was to make a 3D SciFi called "PolyJump();",
but I never got far enough into making the renderer before I abandoned this project. I leave it abandoned here as-is.  

Below are some screenshots from this old project:

The particle system renders points as boxes, the same size as one voxel.

The Voxels are animated, watch him blink.

Geometry will cast shadows, even on the Voxel Models.

This quad has a reflect shader, giving the illusion of water.
