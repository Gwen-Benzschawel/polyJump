# PolyJump
A 3D OpenGL Renderer written in Java with Voxel Support.

This was my first coding project out of college. It's writen in Java. The origional plan was to make a 3D SciFi called "PolyJump();",
but I never got far enough into making the renderer before I abandoned this project. I leave it abandoned here as-is.  

Below are some screenshots from this old project:
